      <h2>The Home Page</h2>
      <p>
        This application includes this home page, a page that fetches data, and a
        page that handles state in a form.
      </p>
      <p>
        These pages, along with the structure of the project, are designed to help
        you get started solving similar technical challenges, based on the
        features you are looking to add to your application.
