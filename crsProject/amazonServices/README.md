This is the temporary README for AWS info.

"allCourses.json" includes an array of all the courses used in our system.

"addItems_Dynamo.py" (name subject to change) will be used to add all of the courses from "allCourses.json" to a DynamoDB table. The name of said DynamoDB table is not included in the file and will need to be provided before attempting to upload the courses. At a later date, this file may include separate functions to add multiple items or add a single item based on a single command. It is important to note that allCourses.json is not finished at this time.
